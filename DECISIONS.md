## Q1 — interactive/design-research — gate-resolution

**Question:** Where should the fact-finding gathered during the design interview live once the session scratchpad is gone?
**Options considered:** leave it in the scratchpad / keep it only in the personal knowledge base / commit it to the repo under `docs/research/`
**Chosen:** Commit it under `docs/research/` with an index, kept separate from `CONTEXT.md` (glossary) and `docs/adr/` (decisions); durable findings are also compiled into the personal knowledge base.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** The design skills in use put the glossary in `CONTEXT.md` and decisions in `docs/adr/` but say nothing about research inputs; the notes are the evidence behind every fact-bound design question, so they belong with the repo that the decisions are about. Cheapest option to reverse (delete a directory).
**Outcome:** applied
**Ref:** `docs/research/README.md`

## Q2 — interactive/design-research — deviation

**Question:** The research notes were produced on the maintainer's own machine and tailnet. May they be committed as produced?
**Options considered:** commit verbatim / scrub identifying values and keep the notes / keep the notes out of the repo entirely
**Chosen:** Scrub the node name, Tailscale IPs, tailnet suffix, operator login and scratchpad paths into placeholders, and leave the raw CLI probe samples out of the repo because they carry identity throughout.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** The repository has a public GitHub remote, so anything committed is published; the notes lose nothing of design value without the identifiers. Verbatim `--help` texts contain no identity and are kept.
**Outcome:** applied
**Ref:** `docs/research/README.md`

## Q3 — interactive/repo-setup — gate-resolution

**Question:** The setup answers asked for a local-markdown issue tracker and, in the same pass, for the triage labels to be created; on which tracker should labels be created?
**Options considered:** create the five labels on the GitHub repo anyway / record the label vocabulary in `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` only
**Chosen:** Record the vocabulary only; no GitHub labels created.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** With a local tracker there is no remote issue list for labels to apply to; the label file is what the triage skill reads. GitHub labels can be created on request in one command.
**Outcome:** applied

## Q4 — build/ticket-01 — tradeoff

**Question:** Q23 settled "clippy with warnings denied" but not which lints beyond the default, nor whether the toolchain should be pinned for contributors.
**Options considered:** default clippy only / default plus a small set of lints that encode design constraints / a broad pedantic or restriction group
**Chosen:** Default clippy plus four workspace lints: `unsafe_code` forbidden, `missing_debug_implementations` warned, `clippy::print_stdout` denied, `clippy::unwrap_used` denied with `expect_used` warned. `print_stderr` stays allowed. No `rust-toolchain.toml`; the MSRV is declared in the manifests and checked by its own CI job.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** Two of these are design constraints rather than style: writing to standard output corrupts the stdio transport, and a panic on caller-supplied input turns a tool error into a dropped connection, so both are better caught by the compiler than by review. Logging goes to standard error by design, hence the asymmetry. A pedantic or restriction group would generate noise unrelated to either constraint. Pinning a toolchain file would force every contributor onto one version and hide MSRV breakage until release, whereas a declared MSRV plus a dedicated job tests the thing that actually matters.
**Outcome:** applied

## Q5 — build/ticket-01 — gate-resolution

**Question:** ADR-0002 requires that copyleft dependencies be rejected mechanically, but not which licences count as acceptable.
**Options considered:** deny a named list of copyleft licences / allow a named list of permissive licences and deny everything else
**Chosen:** Allow-list: Apache-2.0 (with the LLVM exception), MIT, MIT-0, the two- and three-clause BSD licences, ISC, Unicode-3.0, Zlib, CC0-1.0, Unlicense and BSL-1.0. Everything else fails, including anything unrecognised. OpenSSL and its system crate are banned by name, and unknown registries and git sources are denied.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** A deny-list passes anything it has not heard of, which is the wrong default for a boundary the project's licence depends on; an allow-list fails closed and the failure is a one-line review rather than a licence incident. The list is what a normal Rust dependency tree actually uses, so the check should be quiet until something genuinely new appears. The OpenSSL ban makes the rustls decision mechanical too, since it is otherwise easy to reintroduce through a transitive default feature.
**Outcome:** applied

## Q6 — build/ticket-04 — interpretation

**Question:** The design fixed the error vocabulary at fourteen codes and named thirteen of them explicitly: the eight agreed at the outset, the platform one, and four added later (`conflict`, `rate_limited`, `result_too_large`, `confirmation_required`). The fourteenth was counted but never named.
**Options considered:** `not_found` for a target that does not exist / a second CLI code splitting parse failures from command failures / drop the count to thirteen
**Chosen:** `not_found`.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** A device, user, key or webhook that is not there is the single most common tailnet failure an agent will hit, and it is the one where the right next step differs sharply from the generic case: re-list and pick again, rather than retry or escalate. Folding it into `api_error` with a status of 404 makes the agent parse a number to find that out. Dropping to thirteen would contradict a settled count for no gain.
**Outcome:** applied
**Ref:** `crates/tailscale-mcp/src/error.rs`

## Q7 — build/ticket-03 — interpretation

**Question:** `TAILSCALE_MCP_TOOLSETS` was settled as taking `+x,-y` adjustments to a preset. It was not settled what a bare name means, nor what a mixture of the two forms means.
**Options considered:** treat a bare name as `+name` / treat a bare list as an outright replacement of the preset, and refuse a mixture / accept only prefixed entries
**Chosen:** A list where every entry is bare replaces the preset's selection; a list where every entry is prefixed adjusts it; a mixture is a startup error naming the problem.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** Both pure forms are ones operators reach for, and each is unambiguous on its own. The mixture is the only genuinely ambiguous case — `local-status,-tailnet-org` reads as "just this one" to one person and "add this, drop that" to another — so it is refused rather than resolved to whichever reading we happened to implement. Refusing at startup is consistent with the settled rule that a zero-tool configuration does not start.
**Outcome:** applied

## Q8 — build/ticket-05 — tradeoff

**Question:** The design requires a timed-out CLI call to be terminated gracefully before it is killed, but the workspace forbids `unsafe`, and neither the standard library nor tokio can send `SIGTERM` without it.
**Options considered:** relax `unsafe_code` to `deny` in the CLI crate and call `libc::kill` / take the `nix` dependency for its safe signal wrapper / skip the graceful step and kill directly
**Chosen:** Depend on `nix` (unix targets only, `signal` feature) and call its safe `kill`.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** The graceful step is not decoration: `tailscale` unwinds partially-applied preference changes on the way out, so a killed process can leave the node in a state nobody asked for. Relaxing the `unsafe` forbid to write one FFI call would spend a workspace-wide guarantee on a single line. `nix` is permissively licensed, already ubiquitous in the Rust process-handling ecosystem, and target-gated so it does not reach Windows, where there is no `SIGTERM` to send and killing directly is the honest behaviour.
**Outcome:** applied
**Ref:** `crates/tailscale-cli/src/exec.rs`; `Cargo.toml` workspace dependencies

## Q9 — build/ticket-05 — tradeoff

**Question:** Ticket 05 requires process execution to be tested against a stub binary. A stub needs to be a real executable that cargo can locate from a test, but it is not part of what the crate offers.
**Options considered:** ship the stub as a normal binary target / put it in `src/bin/` and exclude the directory from the published package / write a shell script into a temporary directory at test time
**Chosen:** `crates/tailscale-cli/src/bin/tailscale-stub.rs`, auto-discovered by cargo so that `CARGO_BIN_EXE_tailscale-stub` resolves for integration tests, with `exclude = ["src/bin/**"]` in the manifest so it never reaches the registry.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** The environment variable is the only reliable way to find a built helper across platforms and target directories, and it is set for binary targets alone. A shell script would not run on Windows, where the process behaviour being tested differs most. Excluding the directory rather than declaring the target explicitly means the published crate has neither the file nor a declaration pointing at a missing file, so `cargo package --verify` still builds.
**Outcome:** applied
**Ref:** `crates/tailscale-cli/Cargo.toml`; `crates/tailscale-cli/src/bin/tailscale-stub.rs`

## Q10 — build/ticket-02 — interpretation

**Question:** Confirmation was settled as a `confirm: true` argument on the tools that need it. It was not settled whether that argument belongs in each tool's parameter type or is supplied by the framework.
**Options considered:** a `confirm` field on every parameter struct that needs one / inject the property into the schema and enforce it in the registry, stripping it before the handler runs
**Chosen:** Injected by the registry from the metadata row, and removed from the arguments before the handler sees them.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** The rule and its enforcement end up in the same place, so a tool marked as requiring confirmation cannot be shipped with a parameter struct that forgot the field — the failure mode that matters, since it fails open. It also keeps roughly twenty parameter structs free of a field that has nothing to do with what they describe, and keeps the refusal message uniform.
**Outcome:** applied
**Ref:** `crates/tailscale-mcp/src/registry.rs`

## Q11 — build/ticket-06 — gate-resolution

**Question:** Ticket 06 requires a supported version floor "from upstream changelogs", but upstream publishes no end-of-life policy and no minimum supported client version.
**Options considered:** track the newest stable and warn below it / pick the oldest release the whole tool surface exists in / pick the newest release that a default-preset command needs / declare no floor at all
**Chosen:** 1.78, the release that introduced `tailscale metrics`, which is the newest command in the default `core` preset. Below the floor the server warns once on standard error and hides nothing; commands newer than the floor carry their own `min_version`.
**Decided-by:** agent
**Justification:** Tailscale's client-version reference documents the three release tracks and states no minimum, and their public position is that they do not break clients people still run, so there is no upstream answer to read off — the floor is a claim about what this server models. Anchoring it to the default preset makes the claim testable: an operator running a supported version never meets a missing command without having opted into a non-default toolset. Anchoring to the newest stable would strand anyone a release or two behind, and anchoring to the oldest release containing every tool would put the floor below 1.32, which we would be asserting without being able to check. Warning rather than hiding follows because the version string is a capability guess: a fork or distribution build can report a version that does not describe what it implements, and refusing a command the binary actually has is a worse failure than letting the CLI answer for itself.
